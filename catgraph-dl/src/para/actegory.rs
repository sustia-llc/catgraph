//! `M`-actegories — categories acted on by a monoidal category.
//!
//! CDL §3.1: an `M`-actegory `(C, ▶)` consists of a category `C` and an
//! action `▶ : M × C → C` together with coherence witnesses that play the
//! role of the monoid laws of the parameter category. The
//! [`Actegory::compose_action`] method captures the pseudo-functorial
//! coherence
//!
//! ```text
//! μ : Q ▶ (P ▶ X) → (Q ⊗ P) ▶ X
//! ```
//!
//! used in the sequential composition rule for `Para(M, C)`.
//!
//! ## HKT shape
//!
//! The result of acting on an object is a Generic Associated Type
//! [`Actegory::ActionResult`]. For [`SetActegory`] (the only Phase DL-2
//! instance), `▶` is Cartesian product, so `ActionResult<P, X> = (P, X)`.
//! Other DL-3+ instances may project differently — e.g. an `R`-module
//! actegory would project `(P, X) ↦ P · X` for some scalar action.
//!
//! Closure convention: `Fn((P, X)) -> Y` (tuple-as-single-argument). See the
//! `monoidal_category` module for the rationale.
//!
//! ## Why methods take `&self`
//!
//! [`Actegory::act`] and [`Actegory::compose_action`] take `&self` for the
//! same DL-4+ future-proofing reason as [`MonoidalCategory`] — see the
//! [`super::monoidal_category`] "Why methods take `&self`" section. Future
//! instances over richer actegories (R-module action carrying a base ring;
//! vector-bundle action carrying a connection; coalition's `QuantaleActegory`
//! carrying Tropical-flavoured min-weight semantics) will use the `&self`
//! slot for runtime data. [`SetActegory`] is a ZST so the receiver is
//! unobservable today, but freezing the trait at static methods would force
//! a breaking change later.
//!
//! **Rationale validation (v0.4.0):** the coalition v0.5.0
//! `impl Actegory<SetMonoidal>` for the three quantale ZSTs is the first
//! downstream consumer expected to carry runtime data (Tropical zero / one
//! for the underlying min-plus semiring; BTV21 free-monoid generator
//! references; Lawvere-metric embedding parameter). v0.4.0 commits to the
//! `&self` slot for future-proofing; the audit checkpoint fires at
//! coalition v0.5.0 post-shipping review and either ratifies the choice
//! or opens a follow-up to consider static dispatch. See
//! [`AUDIT-CHECKPOINT-v0.4.0.md`](../../docs/AUDIT-CHECKPOINT-v0.4.0.md)
//! for audit criteria.
