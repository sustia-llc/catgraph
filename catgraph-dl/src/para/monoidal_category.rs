//! Monoidal category of parameter spaces.
//!
//! CDL §3.1: `Para(M, C)` is parameterised by a monoidal category
//! `(M, ⊗, I)`. This module exposes the [`MonoidalCategory`] trait surface and
//! provides the concrete instance [`SetMonoidal`] — the monoidal category
//! `(Set, ×, 1)` with object-level tensor `(A, B) ↦ (A, B)` and unit
//! `1 = ()`. CDL takes `(Set, ×, 1)` as the default and it is the only
//! instance currently shipped.
//!
//! ## HKT shape
//!
//! Rust has no kind `* -> * -> *`, so the object-level tensor is encoded as
//! a Generic Associated Type [`MonoidalCategory::Tensor`]. For
//! [`SetMonoidal`] this projects to the Rust tuple `(A, B)`; for the unit
//! object [`SetMonoidal::Unit`] projects to `()`.
//!
//! Coherence isomorphisms (associator, unitors) are exposed as method
//! signatures on values; for `SetMonoidal` they are concrete tuple
//! re-associations and are exact (not "up to iso"). Future instances
//! over richer monoidal categories will need these slots, so the trait
//! surface is widened now to keep their addition a non-breaking transition for
//! [`SetMonoidal`] consumers.
//!
//! ## Coherence laws (machine-checked generically)
//!
//! The associator and unitors must satisfy Mac Lane's **pentagon** and
//! **triangle** identities (see the [`MonoidalCategory`] trait rustdoc for the
//! equations). Since [`MonoidalCategory::tensor_morphisms`] landed (issue #65)
//! the `α ⊗ id` / `id ⊗ α` legs of both diagrams are expressible **on this
//! trait surface**, so the coherence check is a single generic driver —
//! `common::assert_monoidal_coherence`, generic over `MonoidalCategory` — that
//! is machine-checked against `SetMonoidal`, a downstream-style
//! `(Set, ×, 1)`-flavoured ZST (`tests/monoidal_coherence_laws.rs`, issue
//! #40), **and** the non-`Set` [`DirectSum`](super::DirectSum) carrier
//! [`F64Monoidal`](super::F64Monoidal) (`tests/module_actegory_laws.rs`, issue
//! #36). All three hold on the nose (exact isomorphisms, not "up to iso"). For
//! any future instance the laws remain documented implementor obligations, but
//! the same generic driver now checks them without per-instance hand-spelling.
//!
//! Closure convention across the `para` module: `Fn((P, X)) -> Y`
//! (tuple-as-single-argument). This mirrors the `architectures::*` scaffold
//! which uses `fn((f32, u8, u32)) -> u32` etc.
//!
//! ## Why methods take `&self`
//!
//! All five [`MonoidalCategory`] methods (`tensor_objects`, `unit`,
//! `associate`, `left_unitor`, `right_unitor`) take `&self` even though the
//! only shipped instance ([`SetMonoidal`]) is a zero-sized type for which
//! the receiver is unobservable. The `&self` slot is a deliberate
//! future-proofing choice: future instances over richer monoidal categories
//! will carry **runtime data** — an `R`-module instance carries its base
//! ring; a hyperdoctrine instance carries the fibration's projection map; a
//! vector-bundle instance carries its connection. Freezing the trait surface
//! today at "static methods only" would force a breaking change later when
//! those non-`(Set, ×, 1)` instances land.
//!
//! This is a narrow divergence from the `causality:hkt-type-system`
//! convention in `deep_causality_haft`'s core `Functor`/`Monad`
//! witnesses, which use static dispatch exclusively (`VecWitness::fmap(v,
//! f)`, not `v.fmap(f)`, with the witness as a type-level token never
//! instantiated). HAFT itself accommodates runtime payload via a separate
//! `Context` type parameter — e.g. `Adjunction<L, R, Context>` (unified,
//! replacing `BoundedAdjunction`) and the `Effect5::Fixed{1..4}`
//! payload slots. cg-dl's [`MonoidalCategory`] folds the equivalent
//! runtime-payload role into the `&self` receiver instead of carrying a
//! separate `Context` parameter — so the divergence is in the *placement*
//! of runtime data (receiver vs context-parameter), not in HAFT's
//! capacity to carry runtime data at all. cg-dl's choice keeps the API
//! shape aligned with idiomatic Rust trait-method calls (`monoidal.tensor_objects(a, b)`)
//! at the cost of forgoing HAFT's witness-first static-dispatch
//! convention.
//!
//! Since #12, cg-dl's *endofunctor* layer (`ListEndo` / `TreeEndo` /
//! `GroupActionEndo`) adopts HAFT's `HKT` / `Functor` witnesses directly and
//! follows the witness-first static-dispatch convention (`ListEndo::fmap(x,
//! f)`). [`MonoidalCategory`] is therefore the deliberate *local* exception:
//! it keeps the `&self` receiver for the runtime-payload slot while the rest
//! of the crate aligns with HAFT's static dispatch.
//!
//! See `causality:hkt-type-system` skill Gotcha #6 ("Static dispatch only —
//! call `VecWitness::fmap(v, f)`, never `v.fmap(f)`. The witness is a
//! type-level token.") for the HAFT `Functor`/`Monad` static-only side of
//! the comparison; cg-dl deliberately diverges here for the R-module /
//! hyperdoctrine / vector-bundle slot, picking up `&self` payload where
//! HAFT would use a `Context` type parameter.
//!
//! **Rationale validation:** a downstream coalition
//! `impl Actegory<SetMonoidal>` for `UnitIntervalQ` / `TropicalQ` /
//! `QuantaleDefault` is the first consumer expected to carry
//! runtime data (Tropical zero / one for the underlying min-plus
//! semiring; BTV21 free-monoid generator references; Lawvere-metric
//! embedding parameter). The shipped surface commits to the `&self` slot for
//! future-proofing; the audit checkpoint fires at that consumer's
//! post-shipping review and either ratifies the choice or opens a
//! follow-up to consider static dispatch. See
//! [`AUDIT-CHECKPOINT-v0.4.0.md`](../../docs/AUDIT-CHECKPOINT-v0.4.0.md)
//! for audit criteria.
//!
//! ## `(Set, ×, 1)`-flavoured ZSTs via [`SetCategoryDefaults`]
//!
//! Defining a fresh `(Set, ×, 1)`-flavoured ZST instance (with `Tensor<A, B>
//! = (A, B)` and `Unit = ()`) used to require reproducing all five method
//! bodies pointwise. The [`SetCategoryDefaults`] opt-in marker trait now
//! supplies the bodies via a blanket impl: downstream users write
//! `impl SetCategoryDefaults for MyMonoidal {}` (empty body) and the
//! [`MonoidalCategory`] impl is automatic. [`SetMonoidal`] itself uses this
//! path. See [`SetCategoryDefaults`] for the full design rationale, the
//! `: Sized` bound rationale, the conflict-guard caveat for downstream
//! users, and a doctest exercising all five method bodies.

/// ## `: Sized` bound
///
/// The trait carries a `: Sized` supertrait bound. This is a soft witness

/// fail at the bound site rather than silently picking up the blanket and
/// surprising the caller later. The bound costs nothing at the canonical
/// shipping call sites: [`SetMonoidal`] is a unit struct (`Sized` via the
/// default `Sized` bound); the doctest's `MyMonoidal` is too.
///
/// ## ⚠️ Soft-seal
///
/// `SetCategoryDefaults` carries a `: private::Sealed` supertrait bound.
/// Downstream users must `impl Sealed for MyMonoidal {}` AND
/// `impl SetCategoryDefaults for MyMonoidal {}` (two impls) to opt into
/// the `(Set, ×, 1)` blanket. The dual-impl requirement is the
/// commitment-signalling mechanism: a downstream user who writes only
/// `impl SetCategoryDefaults for MyMonoidal {}` (without the parallel
/// `Sealed` impl) gets a clear `Sealed: not satisfied` diagnostic at the
/// impl site, rather than the harder-to-diagnose
/// `conflicting implementations of MonoidalCategory` coherence error
/// that the conflict-guard caveat (below) warns about.
///
/// Rationale: the earlier `Sized`-only bound let a downstream user collide
/// `impl SetCategoryDefaults for MyType {}` + a hand-rolled
/// `impl MonoidalCategory for MyType { ... }` and discover the
/// coherence error LATE (the diagnostic does not name
/// `SetCategoryDefaults` as the proximal cause). The soft-seal
/// surfaces the commitment at compile time at the impl site, where the
/// fix is local and the diagnostic is direct. See
/// [`private::Sealed`] for the trait. The sealing approach (option (a))
/// was chosen over the rejected alternatives.
///
/// ## ⚠️ Conflict-guard caveat (superseded by the soft-seal but still valid)
///
/// **Implementing `SetCategoryDefaults` for a type commits the type to the
/// canonical `(Set, ×, 1)` `MonoidalCategory` body via the blanket impl.**
/// A downstream user who writes both
///
/// ```text
/// impl Sealed for MyType {}
/// impl SetCategoryDefaults for MyType {}
/// impl MonoidalCategory for MyType { type Tensor<A, B> = SomethingElse; ... }
/// ```
///
/// will hit a `conflicting implementations of trait MonoidalCategory for
/// type MyType` compile error from the trait-coherence checker (the
/// soft-seal does not prevent this third case — a deliberate `Sealed`
/// impl + a deliberate hand-rolled `MonoidalCategory` impl is the bypass
/// path the seal does not block). The diagnostic does not name
/// `SetCategoryDefaults` as the proximal cause, so the convention is
/// **don't combine the two impl paths**. If a non-`(Set, ×, 1)`-flavoured
/// `MonoidalCategory` impl is wanted, write `impl MonoidalCategory for
/// MyType { ... }` directly WITHOUT `SetCategoryDefaults` / `Sealed`. If a
/// `(Set, ×, 1)`-flavoured impl is wanted, opt into the dual-impl
/// (`Sealed` + `SetCategoryDefaults`) and let the blanket supply the body.
///
/// ## Implementation note (option (γ-ii))
///
/// At design phase, three options were considered for supplying the default
/// bodies:
///
/// - **(α)** marker trait + blanket impl gated on the marker.
/// - **(β)** `#[derive(SetMonoidal)]` proc-macro — re-affirmed as rejected in
///   [#42](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/42), where the same
///   decision is recorded under the `#[derive(SetCategoryDefaults)]` name (the
///   README documents the dual-impl pattern instead).
/// - **(γ)** sub-trait with GAT default-method bodies on `MonoidalCategory`.
///
/// Option (γ) as originally sketched (sub-trait with default-method bodies
/// inherited by the supertrait's impls) does not type-check on stable Rust:
/// a sub-trait cannot override a supertrait's method bodies. The closest
/// equivalent that compiles is (γ-ii) — a blanket impl carrying the bodies,
/// gated by `SetCategoryDefaults` opt-in. Functionally this is a renamed
/// (α) since both use a marker-with-blanket-impl pattern; the trade-off is
/// essentially zero, and the `SetCategoryDefaults` name better signals the
/// "(Set, ×, 1)-flavoured defaults" intent than a generic `Marker` name.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Defining a fresh `(Set, ×, 1)`-flavoured ZST and getting
/// [`MonoidalCategory`] for free — exercises all five method bodies:
///
/// ```
/// use catgraph_dl::para::{MonoidalCategory, Sealed, SetCategoryDefaults};
