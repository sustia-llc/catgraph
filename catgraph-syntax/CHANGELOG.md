## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Paper-audit citation reconciliation (Phase 6)** — verified every FS18/FS19
  anchor in `docs/ANCHORS.md`, `src/**`, README, and examples against the
  cached papers. Two fixes: (1) the "spider" vocabulary was mis-attributed to
  F&S 2019 §2.2 — the word never appears in that paper; the name + fusion
  theorem are Seven Sketches Def 6.54 / Thm 6.55 (§6.3.1), while F&S 2019
  §2.2/Def 2.5 keeps the SCFM-axiom anchor and Ex 2.8 the apex-1 cospan model
  (`docs/ANCHORS.md`, `frobenius.rs::spider`); (2) `MatKron(R)` was presented
  as F&S 2019 Ex 2.16's content — the example states only that
  FdVect-with-chosen-basis is a hypergraph category \[Kis15\]; the arbitrary-rig
  Kronecker target is now marked an *extension of* Ex 2.16 (`docs/ANCHORS.md`,
  `frobenius.rs`; the released [0.3.0] "(Ex 2.16)" wording below is historical).
  Re-verified as correct: the nine-equation count (FS19 Ex 2.8 + FS18 Def
  6.52's own nine), basis-ROW/Rem 5.49, Prop 3.8 "special", Thm 3.14, Defs
  5.25/5.30/5.33/5.45/5.50, Thm 5.53/5.60, and `frobenius.rs`'s left-only
  unitality/counitality note (PDF p.10 figure check).

### Documentation

- **`arrow_seam` `Free`/`FreeWitness` exclusion rationale refreshed for haft
  0.4.1** ([#93](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/93)): haft's free
  monad now has opt-in `Eq`/`Debug` via the `EqFunctor`/`DebugFunctor`
  capability traits (no longer "opaque by design"), but still no `Clone`/`Hash`/
  serde — so `PropExpr<G>` (which the congruence-closure engine needs `Eq + Hash`
  on) stays the term type. No code change; catgraph-syntax does not adopt haft's
  `Free` (that adoption landed in catgraph-dl per #93).

### Added

- **`depth` module — recursion guard for the term interpreters**
  ([#99](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/99)): `term_depth`
  (iterative, overflow-free), `guard_term_depth`, and `MAX_TERM_DEPTH` (= the
  parser's `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH`, 256). `eval`, `to_mat_kron`, and the Cospan
  functor's `to_cospan` now pre-flight the term's structural depth and return a
  catchable error (`SyntaxError::RecursionLimit`; the `CatgraphError`-typed
  `to_cospan` reports the shared `CatgraphError::RecursionLimit`, one shape across
  all interpreters) instead of risking a stack overflow on
  an unbounded programmatically-built term. The limit is set below the
  *interpreters'* own recursion-overflow point (their frames — Kronecker
  products, cospan pushouts — are heavy), not merely to bound depth. `print`
  stays infallible and documents the same exposure with a `term_depth` pre-check.
  (The recursive `Drop` of a deep `PropExpr` remains an upstream `catgraph-applied`
  concern, out of scope here.)
- **Optional `serde` feature** ([#81](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/81),
  syntax complement): forwards to `catgraph-applied/serde` and derives
  `Serialize`/`Deserialize` on `FrobeniusOr<G>`, so a full syntax term
  `PropExpr<FrobeniusOr<G>>` round-trips through serde — the machine analogue of
  the textual parser/printer. Off by default.
- **`cospan_functor` — a complete decision functor for the pure-spider
  fragment** ([#80](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/80)):
  `CospanFunctor` implements `catgraph-applied`'s `CompleteFunctor<FrobeniusOr<G>>`
  by mapping the **User-free** spider fragment into the free monochromatic
  cospan category and canonicalising up to apex isomorphism (F&S 2019
  Prop 3.8 — `(Cospan, ⊕)` is the theory of *special* commutative Frobenius
  monoids). `Target = CospanCanon<()>`. This is the **second entry in the
  completeness registry** after `Mat(R)`/Thm 5.60: `Presentation::eq_mod_functorial`
  now gives a definite decision for `E_frob` where the congruence-closure
  `eq_mod` is only sound-incomplete (#15). Scalars are **kept** (the closed
  bubble `η;ε` is distinct from `id₀`), so `Cospan` — not the extra-special
  `Corel` — is the target; over an idempotent rig the functor is strictly finer
  than `to_mat_kron`. `User` generators lie outside the fragment
  (`CatgraphError::Presentation`); colored/multi-sorted generality is
  [#79](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/79). Relies on the new
  `catgraph::cospan_canon` canonical form.

### Changed

- `SyntaxError` gains a `RecursionLimit { depth, limit }` variant (#99;
  additive — the enum is `#[non_exhaustive]`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-11

The crate's first release — the complete S1–S5 milestone surface of
[#5](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/5) (design approved
2026-07-09; every phase review-gated). A textual generator/relation
presentation surface for hypergraph-category morphisms over
`catgraph-applied`'s `PropExpr` / `Free` / presentation engine.

### Added

- **S1 — skeleton + printer**
  ([#82](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/pull/82)): workspace member;
  `SyntaxError` (thiserror); `arrow_seam` (the single file naming
  `deep_causality_haft`, per the catgraph-dl `endofunctor.rs` precedent,
  [#12](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/12)); the structural,
  total pretty-printer (`text::{GeneratorSyntax, Pretty, print}`) — never
  normalizes, minimal parentheses (Seven Sketches Def 5.25/5.30);
  `docs/ANCHORS.md` (public-item → theorem map).
- **S2 — parser + presentation files**
  ([#86](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/pull/86)): hand-rolled
  recursive-descent `text::parse` (zero deps) building exclusively through
  `Free::*`, so every parse is arity-sound by construction; Unicode `⊗` as an
  input synonym for `*`; bounded nesting depth (`MAX_NESTING_DEPTH`) on
  untrusted input; structured keyword arguments (`,` is a reserved
  delimiter); presentation files, one `lhs = rhs` per line (Def 5.33) —
  the format carries the equation list only; `GeneratorSyntax` for
  `SfgGenerator<R>` (`scalar:<r>` tokens, round-trip conditions documented).
  Round-trip law `parse(&print(e)) == Ok(e)` proptested (structural, up to
  the depth bound).
- **S3 — interpreter**
  ([#87](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/pull/87)): `eval::ArrowModel`
  (a semantics = the generator action) and `eval` — **O(n) streaming** (each
  subterm consumes exactly its wires from a cursor) with **no `Clone` bound
  on wire values** (duplication is a model concern: the Fanout ≠ Frobenius-δ
  discipline); `SfgModel<R>` (R-linear Σ_SFG semantics; value arithmetic
  inherits `R`'s overflow semantics — documented, see
  [#88](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/88));
  `SyntaxError::{WireCount, ModelArity}`; the enum is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.
  Milestone law: the basis-**row** cross-check against `MatrixNFFunctor`
  (Thm 5.53/5.60; row-vector convention per Def 5.50/Remark 5.49). The
  README example is compile-tested (doctest include).
- **S4 — Frobenius layer**
  ([#89](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/pull/89)): `frobenius::FrobeniusOr<G>`
  (μ/η/δ/ε adjoined to a user signature as a sum type — every engine surface
  works over `PropExpr<FrobeniusOr<G>>` unchanged); `lift_user`; iterative
  `spider(m, n)` / `cup` / `cap`; `scfm_equations()` — the **nine** Def 2.5
  SCFM equations (F&S 2019; the paper's own count, Ex 2.8 — an earlier design
  note said "ten"); `hypergraph_presentation` (user theory ⊎ E_frob, the
  [#15](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/15) boundary restated at
  point of use); `to_mat_kron` into `MatKron(R)` (Ex 2.16) — **sound** per
  Prop 3.8, deliberately not a `CompleteFunctor` (the Cospan-valued spike is
  [#80](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/80)); complete
  cell-count overflow guards (`dim^(src+tgt)` checked before every
  constructor); `SyntaxError::{NonFrobenius, DimensionOverflow}`.
  Monochromatic fragment `Λ = {•}` (colored props are
  [#79](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/issues/79)).
- **S5 — Traced typed builder**
  ([#90](https://github.com/sustia-llc/catgraph/pull/90)): `traced::Traced<A, G>`
  pairs an executable haft `Arrow` with the term it denotes; **sealed**
  `Wires<V>` / `WireCount` bridge (`()` / `Wire<V>` / `(L, R)` pair-trees —
  sealing is a soundness precondition for the combinators' infallibility);
  paired combinators `traced_generator` (the sole fallible constructor),
  `traced_id`, `traced_braid_1_1`, `then` (`>>>`), `par` (`***`) — `then`/`par`
  are **infallible** (type-level interface agreement); `fanout` rejected
  type-level, general `braid(m, n)` and spider arrows deliberately omitted.
  The coherence law `eval(t.term(), &m, in.flatten()) == Ok(t.run(in).flatten())`
  is stated inductively (generators establish it for value-agreeing models;
  combinators preserve it) and tested per combinator. Hughes 2000 cited as
  lineage.
